## example.js

**In this file, the following topics are covered:**

- Understand what an **object** is: a collection of related data represented as **key-value pairs**.
- Learn **object literal syntax** `{ key: value }`.
- Differentiate between **dot notation** and **bracket notation**.

## index.js

Write a function `countWordFrequency(sentence)` that takes a string sentence and returns an **object** showing how many times each word appears.

**Example:**

```jsx
countWordFrequency('the cat and the hat') // => { the: 2, cat: 1, and: 1, hat: 1 }
countWordFrequency('Hi hello hi carmen') // => { Hi: 1, hey: 1, hi: 1, carmen: 1 }
```
